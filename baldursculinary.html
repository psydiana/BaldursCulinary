  <h1>How to make bolinho de chuva</h1>

     <p>Welcome to a new issue elaborated by our cuisine's finest experts! This time around, we took a trip to the
      southern
     hemisphere
     and ventured through the colorfully vibrant Brazil. There we discovered a recipe for a delicacy called "bolinho
     de
     chuva" (little rain cake, literally translating), a sweet, delicious meal perfect for cheering people up on a
     rainy day, as the name suggests. Stay tuned for the ingredients and instructions on how to make a few for
     yourself or
     loved ones!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

         <ul>
             <li>2 (two) eggs;</li>
             <li>1/2 (half) a teacup of sugar;</li>
             <li>1 (one) teacup of milk in room temperature;</li>
             <li>2 (two) teacups and 1/2 (a half) of wheat flour;</li>
             <li>1 (one) tablespoon of baking powder;</li>
             <li>Frying oil;</li>
             <li>To finish the recipe off, 1 (one) teacup of sugar and 1 (one) teaspoon of cinnamon powder.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>*Teacup used: 240 ml</p>

         <p>*Tip: Always fry with a mid-level fire to ensure it does not stay raw on the inside.</p>

  <h2>Preperation:</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, add the 2 eggs, 1/2 teacup of sugar, and a teacup of milk;</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients added for one minute;</li>
        <li>Then add 2 teacups and 1/2 of wheat flour, mixing it again;</li>
        <li>Afterward add 1 tablespoon of baking powder, mixing the ingredients once again until the dough gains a consistent texture, not too soft nor too hard;</li>
        <li>Prepare a frying pan and heat the frying oil at mid-level, avoiding boiling temperature;</li>
        <li>With a tablespoon, scoop the dough into ball-like shapes and dip them into the heated frying oil; </li>
        <li>In case the little rain cakes don't turn themselves over, give them a little nudge to make sure they're a dark gold color on all sides;</li>
        <li>After the dough is fried, scoop some with a spatula and let the excess oil drip down back into the frying pan, then placing them in a container of your choice that has 1 teacup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon foiling its bottom, mixing everything together to coat the bolinhos de chuva;</li>
        <li>And now you enjoy your fresh meal!</li>
     </ol>
